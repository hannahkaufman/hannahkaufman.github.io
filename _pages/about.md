I am a senior at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO. I expect to graduate in December 2022 with a B.S. in mathematics and physics with a minor in computer science. 

I am currently in the process of applying to graduate programs with the goal of receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics. 

## Updates:

**May 2022:** For my senior capstone project I created a video using a Python library called Manim to illustrate and explain Kaczmarz Methods. I was first introduced to these methods during the summer of 2021 when I completed an REU with UCLA. I worked on a team advised by Dr. Jamie Haddock where we looked at these methods in relation to Large Linear Systems. My goal with this capstone project was to open more eyes to what Kaczmarz’s Equation is. I believe that everyone deserves to have math presented in a way that they can see beauty and simplicity in even the most complicated-looking equations. The Kaczmarz Equation is one that I see great beauty in, and it is my hope to make this topic more accessible with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SclGSdwB7M4&t=174s).

**March 2022:** I have been invited to participate in MIT’s Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI) 2022 as a fellow. I’m excited to be introduced to the world of geometry processing and working alongside the program’s instructors, mentors, and other fellows. More information about this program can be found [here](https://sgi.mit.edu/sgi-2022).
