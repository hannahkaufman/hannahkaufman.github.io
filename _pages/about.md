I am a senior at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO. I expect to graduate in December 2022 with a B.S. in mathematics and physics with a minor in computer science. 

I am currently in the process of applying to graduate programs with the goal of receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics. 

## Updates:

**March 2022:** I have been invited to participate in MIT’s Summer Geometry Initiative (SGI) 2022 as a fellow. I’m excited to be introduced to the world of geometry processing and working alongside the program’s instructors, mentors, and other fellows.
